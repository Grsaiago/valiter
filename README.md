# Valiter
A validation library inspired by method chaining and typescript's [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

**This is an experimental library, there is no current major version and the api may change drastically between minor releases.**

## Roadmap
### Common Zod validations
The first goal is to mirror all validations from zod for all fundamental types (String/str, i<n> u<n> f<n>).

### Strings
- [x] min
- [x] max
- [x] length
- [x] startsWith
- [x] endsWith
- [x] uppercase
- [x] lowercase
- [ ] includes
- [ ] regex (feature gated?)
